# Grappling-Hook-Example
How to grapple hook (in Godot 3.3) using Hooke's law. If you make something
with this, it'd be nice to let me know or credit me! (Calvin Wong)

The equation:
F<sub>s</sub> = k<sub>s</sub> * (distance(p<sub>a</sub>, p<sub>b</sub>) - l)
This gives the force F<sub>s</sub> as a scalar (a single number) not a vector.
